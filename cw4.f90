! real, integer, logical, complex, character
! yes in fortran integer and real variables are different from each other
! algorithm for quadratic equation 
! 1 declare variables
! 2 calculate determinant D 
! 3 if D>0, calculate roots (real and different)
!  4 if D<0, calculate roots (imaginary roots)
! 5 if D = 0, calculate roots (identical roots)
program quadratic 
implicit none
